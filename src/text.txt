Before it was named, grep was a private utility written by Ken Thompson to search files for certain patterns.
Doug McIlroy, unaware of its existence, asked Thompson to write such a program.
Responding that he would think about such a utility overnight,
Thompson actually corrected bugs and made improvements for about an hour on his own program called s (short for "search").
The next day he presented the program to McIlroy, who said it was exactly what he wanted.
Thompson's account may explain the belief that grep was written overnight.
